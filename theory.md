### Complexity
O - describes algoritm's speed in amount of operations. The worst speed!

O(n) - dependency O - operations from n - amount of operatioms  we need to get result
O(n) - linear time  
O(log2(n)) - logarithmistic time - the fastest?
!!! Difirence between log and linear options grows faster and faster for every i:[1:n]  
1 vs 1
2 vs 1
3 vs 2
4 vs 2
5 vs 3
...
100 vs 7
...
1000000000 vs 32

Examples:  
n = 100  
O(n) = 100  
O(log2(n)) <= 7 (  2^6 = 64 < n < 2^7 = 128)
